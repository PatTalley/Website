      <p>
        I've been passionate about technology and music ever since I was young.
        I'm a self taught guitar player, music producer and someone that loves
        to learn new skills. I have a background within customer service and IT
        having worked on a service desk. This experience helped me to hone my
        analytical and problem solving skills as well as my communication
        skills. I was first introduced to coding through a program called Tech
        Impact. I loved how coding allowed you to be creative and make something
        for people to enjoy. I've recently graduated from Tech Elevators
        National Live Remote Java Cohort where I learned all the fundamental
        skills to become a successful full stack developer. I'm extremely
        excited to use my newly acquired software development skills and
        positive mindset to provide value to a company!
